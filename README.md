# Welcome

Where I am from and where I have studied - Seattle, CU
What I am interested in - data science, software development, etc.
Jobs I look for - small company, humanitarian, in person

My name is Jack Higgins. I am a graduating senior who studied computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have an interest in software development and data science that I have pursued through my classes at CU. I grew up in the greater Seattle area and graduated from Issaquah High School in 2019. I am graduating in the spring of 2023 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from the school of engineering and a business minor.

Currently, I am looking for job opportunities in either the software development or data science field to grow in my professional life. I have developed a passion for data science, specifically looking at the applications of machine learning in the field to solve humanitarian issues.

# Extracurricular Interests

### Rock Climbing / Bouldering
I picked up rock climbing in late 2022 and have been going to a climbing gym consistently since then. My friends at CU have been climbing for nearly their entire lives so they have been able to teach me some tricks.

### Tennis
When I have gone back to Seattle for the summers I spend my free time playing tennis with friends and family. Can't say I am great, but would love to play consistently when I am out of university.

### Skiing
A big part of why I came to Colorado was to get to ski on weekends. Coming from the Cascades to the Rockies was a great shift in quality and I have had a blast skiing Eldora, Copper, and Winter Park while I have been at CU.
