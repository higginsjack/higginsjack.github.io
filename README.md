My name is Jack Higgins. I am a graduating senior who studied computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have an interest in software development and data science that I have pursued through my classes at CU. I grew up in the greater Seattle area and graduated from Issaquah High School in 2019. I am graduating in the spring of 2023 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from the school of engineering and a business minor.

Currently, I am looking for job opportunities in either the software development or data science field to grow in my professional life. I have developed a passion for data science, specifically looking at the applications of machine learning in the field to solve humanitarian issues.
