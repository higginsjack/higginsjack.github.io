# Welcome

Where I am from and where I have studied - Seattle, CU
What I am interested in - data science, software development, etc.
Jobs I look for - small company, humanitarian, in person

My name is Jack Higgins. I am a graduating senior who studied computer science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have an interest in software development and data science that I have pursued through my classes at CU. I grew up in the greater Seattle area and graduated from Issaquah High School in 2019. I am graduating in the spring of 2023 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science from the school of engineering and a business minor.

Currently, I am looking for job opportunities in either the software development or data science field to grow in my professional life. I have developed a passion for data science, specifically looking at the applications of machine learning in the field to solve humanitarian issues.

# Extracurricular Interests

### Rock Climbing / Bouldering
I picked up rock climbing in late 2022 and have been going to a climbing gym consistently since then. My friends at CU have been climbing for nearly their entire lives so they have been able to teach me some tricks.

### Tennis
When I have gone back to Seattle for the summers I spend my free time playing tennis with friends and family. Can't say I am great, but would love to play consistently when I am out of university.

### Skiing

A big part of why I came to Colorado was to get to ski on weekends. Coming from the Cascades to the Rockies was a great shift in quality and I have had a blast skiing Eldora, Copper, and Winter Park while I have been at CU.

The goal of this project was to develop a model to show the effect of cable news on a stock price. We scraped Internet Archive for years worth of data from CNBC, CNN, Fox Business, and MSNBC. We cleaned the shows by using music identification from pyAudioAnalysis to isolate the shows. From this data we used Whisper to get an accurate transcript of what was said. We pulled stock data from the past 10 years to test with. We identified when companies were spoken about and used OLS regression to create a model.
